    <h1>The Amazing Digestive System</h1>
    
    <p>Hello! Have you ever wondered how yummy food turned into smelly poo? Well, here are the answers! Your digestive system is like a marvelous factory in your body that helps you break down food into nutrients and energy that keep you healthy and strong.</p>

        <p>Here's a simplified description of the digestive system:</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>The process starts in your mouth where you chew your food. Saliva (produced in the salivary glands) in your mouth helps break down the food into smaller pieces. Swallowing sends the food down your esophagus (food pipe) into your stomach. Ripples of muscles along the tube push it down. It is 25 centimeters long!</p>

        <p>Your stomach then churns and mixes the food with acids and enzymes, produced in the gall bladder, pancreas, and live, breaking it down even more.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>After that, the food moves into your small intestine, where most of the digestion and absorption of nutrients happen. The nutrients are then absorbed into your bloodstream by tiny finger-like structures called villi and carried to different parts of your body.</p>
    
    <div class="image">
       
        <p>What's left of the food then moves into your large intestine, where water and some nutrients are absorbed, and the rest is turned into waste, also called stool. Fibre, found in plants that we eat, can't be digested so turns into waste, but it is very important for you. Without it, you wouldn't be able to poop!</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Finally, the waste (poop) leaves your body through the rectum and then the anus when you go to the bathroom.</p>

    <p>That entire journey can take up to forty hours (almost two days)! And that's how your amazing digestive system works!</p>
